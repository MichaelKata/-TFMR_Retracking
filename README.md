# Project Name

## Overview

Project is under reconstruction. Currently missing range corrections and offset grid creation to significantly speed up the calculations.

## Description

This repository is part of my Synthesis Project that aims to create a retracker which is fed a track file from CryoSat-2 and calculates the ground elevation measured along the track in Greenland. Currently it works on LRM mode, but will be expanded to include SAR mode also.

## Installation

No installation is needed. You only need to download the necessary libraries, as specified in 'libraries.py'.

## Usage

For usage, refer to 'Code_Documentation.pdf'

## Special Thanks

Special Thanks to my Synthesis professor for contributing and guiding me to finish the project.
